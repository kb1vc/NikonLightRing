# Description:

  A widget that holds four 12V white LED strips on a ring
  that fits around the base of a Nikon binocular microscope
  with a 2.39 inch diameter ring.

  This is what it looks like on a microscope: ![Nikon Light Ring on a
  Microscope](NikonLightRing.jpg).

  It uses a three element LED strip ![three element LED
  strip](LEDstrip.jpg) that was cut off a reel that I bought surplus.

  See the top of the scad file to find the various parameters that
  can be adjusted to fit whatever LED strip you may have, and to
  fit the collar on your microscope.
